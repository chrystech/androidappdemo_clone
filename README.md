# Team Scavenge 3 -- Fox's Map
## Capstone Project Fall 2018

### Purpose
The purpose of this app is to provide students and faculty an easier way of finding places and people on campus. This includes the ability for students to be able to find instructors and classrooms, as well as to see whether the professor is in a class (and if so, when is it over), off campus, in their office, or providing tutoring in another room or building. Professors would select where they are and to share that information with the student.
The first goal of the project is navigation itself, to use the app for locating places on campus by building number, room number, latitude, longitude, and floor. Because calibration and sensing indoors will be based on tags (iBeacons/qr codes) elevation is less appropriate and far less universal or accurate than floor number as tags include their floor number in their information.
Towards such goal as floor, a measure may be taken to test elevation and if elevation changes, ask the client to scan the nearest tag for recalibration, determining which floor they have just moved to.
